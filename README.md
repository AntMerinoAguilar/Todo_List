# Todo List with Local Storage 📝

This repository contains a **Todo List** project developed as part of my training. The goal of this exercise was to create a functional task manager using **JavaScript**, while leveraging **Local Storage** for data persistence.

## Overview 📋

This project implements a simple **Todo List** application where users can:

- Add tasks.
- View all tasks in a list format.
- Delete individual tasks.
- Persist tasks across page reloads using **Local Storage**.

## Why This Project? 🤔

This exercise introduced me to the concept of **CRUD operations**:

- **Create**: Add a new task to the list.
- **Read**: Display the list of tasks.
- **Update**: Save changes to **Local Storage** after any addition or deletion.
- **Delete**: Remove tasks from the list and **Local Storage**.

It was an excellent opportunity to learn how to work with **Local Storage**, manage state, and interact dynamically with the DOM.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Project Features 🌟

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to include it in the list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks individually with the "Delete" button.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Tasks are saved automatically and persist across page reloads.
